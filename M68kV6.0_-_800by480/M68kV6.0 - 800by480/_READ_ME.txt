Where (which directory) is your SOF file located, and what it is called:

It is in the top folder called "M68kV6.0 - 800by480" and the .sof is called "MC68K.sof"
M68kV6.0 - 800by480\MC68K.sof







Where is your project code located (Verilog and software code):

To open the Quartus project and view all the verilog within the project, please open the Quartus project file named "MC68K.qpf" which is within the top folder M68kV6.0 - 800by480\MC68K.qp

Within the project you will be able to see the different verilog and changes that were made and components added.

The software code is all within the "Snake_Game_Software" folder which is stored here "M68kV6.0 - 800by480\Snake_Game_Software" The project folder is called FINAL-Snake-Game.prj which is within the same folder, pleasure ensure to extract and move this entire folder the "M68kV6.0 - 800by480" to your C drive as the paths wont work for IDE68K project and you will have to manually regard the 6 software files that were in the project
- cstart_V4.0 - UserProgram.asm
- DebugMonitor.h
- M68kUserProgram (DE1).c
- snake.c
- snake.h
- std68k.lib







Where is the video located, and what is it called:

Video is stored here "M68kV6.0 - 800by480\Recording" and the video is called "Snake_Game_Recording.mov"






What is the status of the project (what works, what doesn't):

The whole entire project works as in the recording you can see I was able to get the demo screen, my name and student number dispalyed on hyperterminal, snake is able to move and eat food once it runs into itself it ends game and goes to game over screen just like it when it hits the borders/walls. As well the score increases as the snake eats each food and will progressively get faster. The Game Over screen has the correct animation with the cursor, printing the letters with a delay and colour red and once the texts and scores have been typed out, the text will continue to switch colors with a 300ms delay and will continue to do that until user presses g again and user will be able to play the game again (just like in the video).

The bug I was unable to fix was that whenever the snake eats a food, the coordinate where the food was at before being eaten is unable to display the snake as if the snake has a hole in it. :( Ex. "SSS SSS" but the snake will move away from that coordniate and the snake will look normal again.




Any additional information that would be relevant for the TA marking your project:

This final project was tons of fun and a nice challenge. Thank you TAs for all the help throughout the course it was challenging but fun as the same time!
